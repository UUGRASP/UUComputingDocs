Install the virtual machine software
====================================

What are virtual machines?
--------------------------

A `virtual machine <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine>`__ emulates a whole computer in your own computer.
The size of the virtual machine is large, since you are packing a whole operation system and all the components
necessary to run the ALICE software. The total size is approximately 30 GB. Please be sure that you have enough space
before installing. It is recommended to have at least 40 GB of free space on your computer
(10 GB to download and 30 GB to install).


Install VirtualBox
----------------------

For this setup, the only software you will need is VirtualBox. You can also use another virtual machine software, but
this tutorial only covers the instructions for VirtualBox.
You can download it in the `VirtualBox website <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`__.

The installation process is straightforward. If you have problems, the
`VirtualBox User manual <https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/>`_ has detailed instructions, particularly on
`Chapter 2 <https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html>`_. You should just click "Next" and "Install"
in any popup windows that might show.


Install VirtualBox Extensions
-----------------------------

The extensions will give you a better performance and more feature, so please download the extension pack. It is on the
same page you downloaded `VirtualBox website <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`_. Simply click on the link
*All supported platforms*, bellow *VirtualBox <version> Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack* .

Double click the file, it will open the VirtualBox application and a popup. Click in **Install**.
