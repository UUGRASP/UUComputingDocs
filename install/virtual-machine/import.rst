This will load the **Appliance settings** screen, as seen bellow. This
gives the details of the Virtual Machine. The current values are a
suggestion that should work for most people. If you have 8 GB of RAM and
a dual core processor (or more), you can leave as it is. If you are not
sure, you can check it on
`Windows <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-version-am-i-running>`__,
`Mac <https://support.apple.com/guide/system-information/get-system-information-syspr35536/mac>`__
or
`Ubuntu <https://askubuntu.com/questions/55609/how-do-i-check-system-specifications>`__.

.. warning::
    If you have less than 8 GB of RAM, please consider to change the RAM value to a
    lower value, such as 2048 MB or 3072 MB.

Now click in **Import**.
