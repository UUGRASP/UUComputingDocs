.. _install_own_system:

Install in your current operation system
----------------------------------------

First of all, ROOT, AliRoot/AliPhysics, and most of the software packages used for data analysis of particle
physics **only** work on the following operating systems:

* Linux (Ubuntu and derivatives or CentOS/Scientific Linux)
* Mac OS

If you are in one of these systems, the required software can then be installed with the Linux package manager,
by compilation, or download, following the `AliPhysics installation instructions
<https://alice-doc.github.io/alice-analysis-tutorial/building/>`_.

Make sure your laptop has **all** prerequisites before installation.
