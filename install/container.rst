Install in a container
----------------------

Containers are a recent technology that allows you to run isolated applications. This is super convenient if you
need to install different versions of the same software. Curious? You can check
`what containers are <https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container>`_.
In our case, this can be achieved `using alidock <https://github.com/alidock/alidock/wiki>`_,
which runs the ALICE software inside a container.

.. warning::

    Unfortunately, alidock is not officially supported by ALICE. It works well in most cases, but if you have some
    problems, get in touch with someone from our institute for help.
