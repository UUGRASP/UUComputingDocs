Install Ubuntu in your computer
-------------------------------

If you have a windows laptop and have enough room on your hard disk (50-100 Gb), it is very easy to install a
Linux distribution (Ubuntu) and use the laptop with dual boot. This way you will be asked to either start up Windows
or Ubuntu when you turn on the laptop.

To download Ubuntu, the only thing you have to do is create a USB stick with the
installation image. You can download the latest Long Term Service (LTS) version of Ubuntu from the
`download page <https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop>`_ (make sure to get the LTS version and not one of the
regular releases). Installation instructions starting
from Windows are `in the Ubuntu website
<https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview>`_

Now you can follow the instructions install :ref:`install_own_system`.
