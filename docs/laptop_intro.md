# Setting up the ALICE software on your laptop

There are advantages in using you own laptop for the research project, since your own laptop is always available
and you can work easily from any place. If you want to use your laptop instead of a desktop in the university
please discuss this with your supervisor, but this shouldn't be any problem.

- To [use it in a virtual machine](vm.md) is one of the easiest since it requires almost no setup. 
  It will *likely* provide most of the software you need, if you are using AliPhysics or/and ROOT. 
  It can be particularly suitable for bachelor students, but check with your supervisor.
  It might not be the best if you are not using most of the ALICE software.
- If you are in a supported OS (Linux or MacOS), you can [install in your own system](laptop.md). 
  Not in a supported OS? You can [install Ubuntu](laptop.md#install-ubuntu-in-your-computer).
  This option is a bit more complicated than the virtual machine, but most people in the institute will be able to 
  help you, so it should be fine as well.
- A third option is to [install or use in a container](laptop.md#install-in-a-container). 
  This is a more advanced option.

    If you have any troubles, ask anyone in our institute for help. We have all done these steps too many times and
    you should not be stuck on installations for long.
