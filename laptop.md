# Instructions to run and install AliRoot on your laptop

If you want to use your own laptop for your research project, please discuss with your supervisor. You will likely need a version of Linux installed on your laptop, either as a virtual machine or 'natively' (dual boot).
ROOT, AliRoot and other packages can then be installed with the Linux package manager, by compilation, or download ([using 'docker' for AliRoot](https://github.com/alidock/alidock/wiki))
