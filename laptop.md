# Instructions to run and install AliRoot on your laptop

There are advantages in using you own laptop for the research project, since your own laptop is always available and you can work easily from any place. If you want to use your laptop instead of a desktop in the university please discuss this with your supervisor, but this shouldn't be any problem. 

First of all, ROOT, AliRoot/AliPhysics, and most of the software packages used for data analysis of particle physics __only__ work on the following operating systems:
* Linux (Ubuntu and derivatives or CentOS/Scientific Linux)
* Mac OS

If you have a windows laptop and have enough room on your harddisk (50-100 Gb), it is very easy to install a Linux distribution (Ubuntu) and use the laptop with dual boot. This way you will be asked to either start up Windows or Ubuntu when you turn on the laptop. To download Ubuntu, the only thing you have to do is create a USB stick with the installation image. You can download the latest Long Term Service (LTS) version of Ubuntu from the [download page](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) (make sure to get the LTS version and not one of the regular releases). Installation instructions starting from Windows are [here](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview)

ROOT, AliRoot and other packages can then be installed with the Linux package manager, by compilation, or download, following the instructions here:
* [AliRoot installation insctructions](https://alice-doc.github.io/alice-analysis-tutorial/building/)
* [using 'docker' for AliRoot](https://github.com/alidock/alidock/wiki) 

Make sure your laptop has __ALL__ prerequisites before installation. 

If you have any troubles, ask anyone in our institute for help. We have all done these steps too many times and you should not be stuck on intstallations for long.
