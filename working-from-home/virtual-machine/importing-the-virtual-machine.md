# Importing the VM

First, you need to download the image file. The VM images are available in the SURFdrive, click on [this link](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/hixP7HtZlOASXq6) to download. The file has 11GB. 

Open the app you just installed, **Oracle VM VirtualBox,** and click in **Import**

It will open a new windows called **Import Virtual Assistance**. Click on the Icon on the right to **Find a File**. Select the file with the VM \(_ALICE.ova_\) and select click in **Open** to confirm. Then you are back to the previous screen and you can click on **Next**.

This will load the **Appliance settings** screen, as seen bellow. This gives the details of the Virtual Machine. The current values are a suggestion that should work for most people. If you have 8 GB of RAM and a dual core processor \(or more\), you can leave as it is. If you are not sure, you can check it on [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-version-am-i-running), [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/system-information/get-system-information-syspr35536/mac) or [Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/55609/how-do-i-check-system-specifications). If you have less than 8 GB of RAM, please change the RAM value to a lower value, such as 2048 MB or 3072 MB.

Now click in **Import**.

Now, check that **Auto-mount** is selected. If not, select it. In **Folder Name**, you can add the name you would like. For example, you can leave the automatic name generated by the program (which will be your username) or to call it _alice_. Then click **OK** and **Ok** again.
