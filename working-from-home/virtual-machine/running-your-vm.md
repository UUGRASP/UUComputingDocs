Wait, the machine will automatically login and open the Desktop. Now you can use it! 

To open the a program, for example the Terminal, you can click on **Activities** on the top left and type in the search box. 

To open the Alice enviroment, just type **ali** in the terminal.

The machine includes Emacs and sublime text to edit text, but you can in principle add anything you would like.

This will be soon updated with information on how to install additional programs.
