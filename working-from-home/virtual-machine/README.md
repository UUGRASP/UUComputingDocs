# Virtual Machines

A [Virtual Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) emulates a whole computer. The size of the virtual machine is large, since you are packing a whole operation system and all the components necessary to run the ALICE software. The total size is approximately 30 GB. Please be sure that you have enough space before installing. It is recommended to have at least 40 GB of free space on your computer (10 GB for download and 30 GB to install).

## Install VirtualBox

The only software you will need is VirtualBox. You can download [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), under _VirtualBox 6.1.4 platform packages_. The current versions are also provided bellow:

* [Window](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.1.4/VirtualBox-6.1.4-136177-Win.exe)[ ](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.1.4/VirtualBox-6.1.4-136177-Win.exe)
* [Mac](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.1.4/VirtualBox-6.1.4-136177-OSX.dmg)
* [Linux](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads)

The installation process is straightforward. If you have problems, the [VirtualBox User manual](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/) has detailed instructions, particularly on [Chapter 2](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html). You should just click "Next" and "Install" in any popup windows that might show.

### Install VirtualBox Extensions

Download the extension pack. It is on the same page you download VirtualBox, [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Simply click on the All supported platforms or in this[ link](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.1.4/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-6.1.4.vbox-extpack).

Double click the file, it will open the VirtualBox application and a popup. Click in **Install**.
