# What are the options?

## [Virtual Machine \(VM\)](virtual-machine/)

Works on Windows, Mac or Linux. You do not need to install anything on your own system, apart from the VM client. Once in the virtual machine is ready, you can use it as a self-contained system. We have already installed all the required software. If something is missing, you can easily install it or let me know.

This is likely the easiest method, but you will need ~30GB of free space in your computer. To have an optimal experience, I would recommend a computer with at least 8 GB of RAM and two cores.

## [SSH \(lxplus or nikhef\)](ssh/)

**If you have a CERN account**, you have easy access to a lxplus, the CERN linux server. It likely contains all the software you need. It requires no space on your computer.

**If you have a NIKHEF account**, you can request access to a stoomboat. It also contains all the software you need. It requires no space on your computer.

## Install the software in our own machine

This may be an option if you have **Mac or Linux**. More details on [here](../laptop.md). 

On Windows, it is technically possible using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), but it might be hard. I would recommend to use one of the previous options or even install Ubuntu on your computer. If you would like to try, first follow the procedure in [here](readme/setup-ubuntu-usage-on-windows-10.md), to install WSL, and then follow the procedure [here](../laptop.md) as if you were using a Ubuntu machine.
