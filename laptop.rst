Setting up the ALICE software on your laptop
============================================

There are advantages in using you own laptop for the research project, since your own laptop is always available
and you can work easily from any place. If you want to use your laptop instead of a desktop in the university
please discuss this with your supervisor, but this shouldn't be any problem.

There are some possibilities:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   install/virtual-machine/vm
   install/current_system
   install/ubuntu
   install/container

Some recommendations:

- To :ref:`use_virtual_machine` is one of the easiest since it requires almost no setup. It will *likely* provide most
  of the software you need. It is particularly suitable for bachelor students, but check with your supervisor.
  It might not be the best if you need to change code inside AliPhysics, for example, or if you are not using most of
  the ALICE software.
- If you are in a supported OS, you can :ref:`install_own_system`. Not in a supported OS? You can :ref:`install_ubuntu`.
  This option is harder than the virtual machine, but most people in the institute will be able to help you, so it
  should not be too hard.
- A third option is to :ref:`install_container`. This is a more advanced option.

.. important::
    If you have any troubles, ask anyone in our institute for help. We have all done these steps too many times and
    you should not be stuck on installations for long.
